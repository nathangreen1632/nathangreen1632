# Hi there, I'm Nathan! 👋

## 🚀 A little about me

I'm [@nathangreen1632](https://github.com/nathangreen1632), a full-stack software engineer and founder of **One Guy Productions**, a boutique software studio that has shipped 3 real-world applications for satisfied customers. I'm a graduate of **The University of Texas at San Antonio’s** Full-Stack Software Engineering program and I love building powerful, user-friendly web apps where most goals are achievable in **2–3 clicks**.

I still thrive on practical problem-solving and the thrill of bringing new ideas to life. Before diving into software engineering, I spent over 11 years excelling in technical sales and leadership roles, bringing a unique perspective combining technical know-how with business acumen.

## 👀 I'm interested in...

- Creating **enterprise-grade applications** that solve real problems for a lot of people.
- Developing AI-driven and data-informed web apps, especially using Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Full-stack development with **React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL**.
- Building Stripe-powered platforms: marketplaces, SaaS products, and transactional apps.
- Designing sleek, **user-focused UI/UX** with clear flows and minimal friction (2–3 click success).

## 🌱 I'm currently learning...

- **Advanced React 19** patterns and modern React architecture.
- **TypeScript** at scale, with strict typing and shared types across client/server.
- **CSP (Content Security Policy)** handling and secure embedding of third-party content.
- **Stripe** payment integrations, including Connect, webhooks, and robust error handling.

## 💡 Projects I'm proud of...

- **Dell Technologies (2017-2018)**: Exceeded sales quotas by 246%, inducted into SEAL team for top 1% sales achievement, managed enterprise solutions for 1,132 accounts.

## 🎓 Education

- **Texas State University** — B.A. in Political Science and Finance (2013)  
  - Built a strong foundation in analytical thinking, economics, and public systems—skills I now apply to software architecture and problem-solving.
- **The University of Texas at San Antonio** — Full-Stack Software Engineering  
  - Focused on advanced JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and LLM API integration. Completed multiple capstone projects and gained real-world experience in agile development, testing, and deployment.

## 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on...

- **Production-ready web apps** for small businesses, teams, and founders who need their first real deployed product.
- **Stripe-integrated platforms** (marketplaces, SaaS billing, donor/tenant portals, subscription services).
- **React + TypeScript** projects that care about clean architecture, strong typing, and smooth UX.
- Tools and platforms that help communities, ministries, or organizations operate more efficiently at scale.

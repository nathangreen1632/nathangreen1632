# Hi there, I'm Nathan! 👋

## 🚀 A little about me

I'm @nathangreen1632, an engineering student passionate about creating powerful, user-friendly web applications and leveraging AI to build innovative solutions. I thrive on practical problem-solving and enjoy the thrill of bringing new ideas to life. Before diving into software engineering, I spent over 11 years excelling in technical sales and leadership roles, bringing a unique perspective combining technical know-how with business acumen.

## ⛷️ Professional Skiing Background
- Competed professionally for 7 years until a career-ending injury in 2012.
- My home mountains were Whistler/Blackcomb in Vancouver, Canada, with Breckenridge and Keystone, Colorado as my second homes.
